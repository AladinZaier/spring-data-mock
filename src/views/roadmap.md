Roadmap
=======

 > **Note**: it might be a better idea to follow
 [the milestones](https://github.com/mmnaseri/spring-data-mock/milestones)
 and features rather than read this document, since I might at times
 forget to update the roadmap after curating the list of features and
 planned resolutions.

Trivial
-------

Nothing is at the works right now.

Minor
-----

  * [#29](https://github.com/mmnaseri/spring-data-mock/issues/29):
  Add logging to operations

Major
-----

  * [#25](https://github.com/mmnaseri/spring-data-mock/issues/25):
  Restructure the project to allow for a more sophisticated build reactor
  that would let us extend the project by adding optional artifacts that
  are used alongside the original artifact.

  * [#3](https://github.com/mmnaseri/spring-data-mock/issues/3):
   Add support for `QueryDslPredicateExecutor`
