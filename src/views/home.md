-----------

Spring Data Mock is a framework for mocking Spring
Data repositories.

### Download

You can download this framework via:

  * [Github](http://github.com/mmnaseri/spring-data-mock)
  * Maven Central by adding this dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

      <pre>
        <code>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>com.mmnaseri.utils</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-data-mock</artifactId>
                <version>${latest-version}</version>

        </code>
      </pre>
  * By cloning the project and installing it locally:

        git clone https://github.com/mmnaseri/spring-data-mock.git
        cd spring-data-mock
        mvn install

    and then adding the same dependency as above, or just grabbing the
    JAR file locally from the `target` folder.


### Change Log

You can see the change log for this project at the [Changes](#/changelog) page.

### Future

The future of this project depends highly on the availability of contributors.

At the moment I am maintaining this myself since this is something I actively
use (that is actually how this framework was born to begin with).

However, there is [a road map](#/roadmap) that I keep, just to stay focused when I do
any development work on this project.

### Issues and Feature Requests

If you have any issues or if there are features that you require, you are more than
welcome to  submit them via the [issues page](https://github.com/mmnaseri/spring-data-mock/issues)
at Github. I will try to keep track of them, and assign them to a planned future release.

Here is how this framework looks like right now:
