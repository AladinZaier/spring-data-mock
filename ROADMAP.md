Roadmap
=======

 > **Note**: it might be a better idea to follow
 [the milestones](https://github.com/mmnaseri/spring-data-mock/milestones)
 and features rather than read this document, since I might at times
 forget to update the roadmap after curating the list of features and
 planned resolutions.

Trivial
-------

  * [#17](https://github.com/mmnaseri/spring-data-mock/issues/17):
  Add more JavaDoc to classes so that published sources and documentation
  at Maven Central make more sense and are more helpful.

Minor
-----

  * [#18](https://github.com/mmnaseri/spring-data-mock/issues/18):
  Increase test coverage so that future development can be done with more
  certainty and users feel better about the source code they use.

Major
-----

  * [#25](https://github.com/mmnaseri/spring-data-mock/issues/25):
  Restructure the project to allow for a more sophisticated build reactor
  that would let us extend the project by adding optional artifacts that
  are used alongside the original artifact.
