<h1 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: it might be a better idea to follow
 <a href="https://github.com/mmnaseri/spring-data-mock/milestones">the milestones</a>
 and features rather than read this document, since I might at times
 forget to update the roadmap after curating the list of features and
 planned resolutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="trivial">Trivial</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mmnaseri/spring-data-mock/issues/17">#17</a>:
Add more JavaDoc to classes so that published sources and documentation
at Maven Central make more sense and are more helpful.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="minor">Minor</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mmnaseri/spring-data-mock/issues/18">#18</a>:
Increase test coverage so that future development can be done with more
certainty and users feel better about the source code they use.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mmnaseri/spring-data-mock/issues/27">#27</a>:
Increase code quality metrics</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mmnaseri/spring-data-mock/issues/28">#28</a>:
Update project dependencies</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="major">Major</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mmnaseri/spring-data-mock/issues/25">#25</a>:
Restructure the project to allow for a more sophisticated build reactor
that would let us extend the project by adding optional artifacts that
are used alongside the original artifact.</li>
</ul>
